      <h1 class="display-6">Gameplay</h1>
      <p>Trivial Compute is a turn-based game where players roll dice and answer questions to advance on the game board. The game board is a grid composed of 45 squares, representing 4 categories with 10 questions each, as well as four "roll again" squares, and one "home square" where all players start and finish the game.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The current player rolls the dice</li>
        <li>The player moves their token</li>
        <li>The player answers the question that is presented to them. If they landed on a "roll again" square, they may roll again instead.</li>
        <li>If the player answers correctly, they may roll again. If they were on a HQ square, then they gain a point for that category.</li>
        <li>If the player answers incorrectly, the turn passes to the next player.</li>
        <li>The first player to reach the home square with a point in each category wins the game.</li>
      </ol>
